Project Empathy
Deployment of Jenkins using Puppet

- This module is based on "puppet-jenkins" module created by rtyler
  from the Jenkins project.

Integration into PE 2.0 (Ubuntu specific, can be extened for other platforms)

- Copy "jenkins/" into your module path

Using the Dashboard:
  - create a class named jenkins
  - Edit your desired target node(s) and add the jenkins class

The class contains facilities to install Jenkins plugins that we have not used yet;
will update this doc as we progress.
